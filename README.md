# NotApp

I didn't like Apple's own notebook, so I created my own notebook and that's where I keep my notes.

Also, while publishing this application on the App store, I made a not bad ASO (app store optimization) without realizing it, and when you type Simple in the search field, the name of my application automatically appears in the search field (Simple Notepad). This helped the app to get some downloads :D
